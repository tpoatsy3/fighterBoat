# Welcome to Fighter Boat!

Welcome to my 'for fun project' that I'm using as a coding sample for my upcoming
job search. This is a Battleship inspired game that allows upto 5 players on the
same LAN connection to play a game of battleship.

### Architecture

The game has two pieces: the server and the client. Each LAN will only need to run 
one server while each player will need to run a client.

### Playing

##### gameServer.py

`python3 gameServer.py <server ip address> <server port>`


##### gameClient.py

`python3 gameCleint.py <server ip address> <server port>`
